The [**RPi Pico 2 RP2350**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) is used as a **Touch LCD MacroPad** with direct access to five file-types: (a) file-path-pointers (similar to symbolic links - note 3), (b) macros (note 4), (c) textstrings (note 5), (d) linkfiles (note 2), and (e) \*codes (note 6). From Layout 2 (Configuration), 92,628 files or "nKeys", grouped as 36 sets of type (a) (aA01-xX996 and 0001-9996), and 14,940 files of types (b) to (e), are directly available from the right-side touch pad [n] - with the Pad character showing the current selected nKeys character set (note 7).<br> 

In addition, from Layouts 1, 3, and 4 (Macro Sets M, S and T), nine sets of 24 keys of types (b), (c), (d), and (e), (mM01-mM24, sS01-sS24, tT02-T24), as well as another six sets of 99 files (aA01-aA99 and kK01-kK99), are available (note 1). Each of the macro or text or nkeys keys, or files stored on the sdcard or flash, can be further linked through a plaintext list of 3-letter filenames with additional processing such as delay and repeat, storage switching, and chaining  or further linking. There are also another 456 (19 sets of 24 files), text files which can be accessed from the SDCard using the same macro-keys. Processing of very large text files, tested up to 67kB (manual.h), but probably only limited by SDFS or LittleFS or FAT32 filesystem size constraints, are available through the nKeys sets.<br> 

There are more than 60 different pages (excluding the 8,964 nKeys pages), and layouts for actions such as Media-keys (Volume Mute Play-Stop Next-Previous Bass-Treble), inserting special characters such as the Greek alphabet, and various mathematics symbols, a Restart-Shutdown Timer and Time(Clock) Configuration, Timer-and-Time-executed repeat-and-oneshot macros, a Macro Composition, Manipulation, File, and Linking editor, a Mouse-button, Scroll-wheel and cursor movement Keypad, an enhanced 8 page Numberpad, and easy access for the display of PC sensor data (via HWInfo), Music Player information (via Foobar2000), PC Time or Date values, and many other manipulated data sources from a PC running GNU/Linux, and/or Windows.<br> 

Note 1: Macro definitions (A1-A99, K1-K99, S1-S24, T1-T24, M1-M24), and the 36 x 996 nKeys set, can be stored on the flash file-system as lowercase filenames (such as s1-s24 etc), or uppercase filenames (S1-S24), or on the SDCard as case-insensitive but case-preserving files (s=S1-s=S24 etc.), using Layouts 1,3, and 4 - and many times more are available from Layout 2.<br> 

Note 2: Linklist files can be chained to load another linklist file, through LxyXnn where Xnn is the name of the next XnnLink file to be loaded and executed according to its content, and Lxy indicates various SDCard/Flash options for where the next linklist is stored, and how any switch between Flash memory and SDCard storage, should be handled. A repeat = 20 rnn and Rnn with r = repeat 1-99 and R - repeat 100 to 9900, and three delays = 0.5 and 3 seconds, with dnn, ddn, Dnn, DDn with d 0.1-0.9, and 1-99 seconds, D 1-99 minutes, and DDn 1-9 hours, was used in the macrolink string *a50a51dd5a53d03r20a52d03U02* for the macro animation as shown in the right-hand picture above. Refer to the [**manual**](manual.md) and the Extras - DuckyPad section, for more details.<br>

<img src="images/pico2b.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> Note 3: The 100k+ nKeys files are neither macros, textstrings, ,\*codes, nor linkfiles. For each alphanumeric first character (aA-xX and 0-9), there is a (configurable) maximum of 83 pages, each with 12 keys per page. They are file-pointers with a path - i.e. folder and file name, of any length less than 200 characters, on the same storage (Flash or SDCard) as the current set, to be executed as either a macro, textfile, linkfile, or \*code. There are (at least), 36 x 996 x 3 = 107,568 of these nKeys available for use from Pad [n] in Layout 2. *Redirection* means that for example, if file n01 contains the text /passwords/BoA.txt then pressing nKey n01 will send the text from the file BoA.txt in folder /passwords to the current focus(s)ed PC application such as a browser or text editor. To change the nKeys first character n use a *code \*0n\*char - for example \*0n\*p will change the nKey set, and filenames used to p01 - p996. Use \*Code \*0s\*list-of-10-char to change a quick-access list. Press [Cfg][Opt] and Pad[o] to select the nKeys set or first character, from a list of 10 - the default is n o p q r s t m a k. Note that when the nKey first character is m,s,t,a,k then the nKeys list will interpret these as macros, textstrings, linkfiles or \*codes, and not as a filepath or filename.  From Layouts 1 ,2, and 3 there are 24 M, S, T keys, but 996 in Layout 2. As expected, if the contents of for example, nKey n01 is the text "s11Link", it will attempt the execute the link list contained in the file named "s11Link". Code \*0x\* toggles the naming of the first 99 nKeys between n01-n99 to n001-n099. Use \*0p\*nn to change the number of nKey pages from 83 to a more manageable size - the default is 20 and the minimum is 1 - note that 83 x 12 = 996. Use code \*0d\*/Directory - 20 char max folder name to be used for saving and reading all nKeys files aA-XXnn,0000-9999. Default is "/" - use \*0d\*/ or just \*0d\* to reset to the default i.e. no folder in front of the filename. Use the special entry \*0d\*// where the nKeys char is used as a folder name such as file n03 key [n03], saved/read from folder /n/, or file q112 read/saved in folder /q/.<br> 

The versatility of these *indirected* set of files lies with the *ease in which a large number of actions can be controlled through a single folder rename*. For example: If there are three folders named AppA, AppB, and AppC, and each folder has 96 specialized macros or strings for the three different applications A, B, and C, then changing the folder name AppA, B, C to that contained in a nKey set such as CurrentApp, will redirect the nKey set of for example 96 keys (if nKeys pages=8), to execute the specialized actions for each of the selected Apps A, B, or C.<br>

Note 4: *Macros* are considered here to be that sub-group of HID touch-keys, touch-buttons, and touch-scrollers, that when touch-pressed send and receive, simultaneous or sequential, in (almost) any combination and length, and with variable speed, HID data and control characters via a PC USB interface.<br> 

Note 5: *Large text file processing:* The nKeys set can handle very large text strings - preferably stored on the SDCard - using nKeys such as those starting with the letters n,o,p,q,r - each with 996 keys over 83 pages. Keys M,S,T 1-24 are best used for textfiles with less than 200 characters, and M,S,T 25-996 for larger textfiles, or use any of the nKeys such as the N,O,P,Q,R 1-996 quick-access sets, for large text files. Example: Copy two large (>20kB) files named L1 and S12 on the SDCard using a PC. Then program nKey n01 with the content L1 - Use the KeyBrd Editor - press Pad [k] and set n01 as the Source - in brown not white - and then do L[Add]1[Add][Sav]. Test by pressing the nKey [n01]. Change the nKey letter-set to S with [Cfg][Opt]PadKey[o] and then press the nKey [S12] - this was tested for both keys with an opened notepad.<br>

Eight keys - normally the [Cut][Copy]Paste[Delete][Return][cX][cC][cV] keys - can be assigned from 54 functions in Layouts 1, 3 and 4 - the functions are: 1 Delete 2 Backspace 3 Tab  4 AltTab 5 Insert 6 Esc 7 PScr 8 AltPScr 9 Return 10 Snipping 11 OnScrKeyBrd 12 UnDo 13 ReDo 14 CtrAltDel 15 Cut 16 Copy 17 Paste 18 TaskMan 19 Run 20 GuiX 21 Copilot 22-27 Tskbar1-6 28-51 K1-K24 NumLock 52 CapsLock 53 ScrollLock 54. The 24 K keys use the plaintext linking method as explained above - refer to the Extras - DuckyPad section, or the manual, for examples.<br> 

Note 6: Controlling the user interface appearance and functions are done using an extensive set of starcodes which can be run from files stored on Flash or the SDCard, or entered on the TouchLCD, or sent via a PC serial port, or a Powershell command to the MacroTouchpad. For example sending <\*x9\*0102030405060719> will set all 8 special keys - normally the Cut-Copy-Paste-Delete-Return keys, to new actions and labels - the 8 keys will then be Del Bks Tab aTb Ins Esc and [Del] = PrS and [Ret] = Run. Using a Powershell get-process, one can then set these keys according to which PC application is open. These \* commands can also be in a macrolink file.<br>

This means it is possible with a single macropad keypress to open for example photoshop on a PC, and at the same time re-configure the macropad keys for photoshop-specific functions. See Note 8 in the [**manual**](manual.md) for more detail.<br>

Note 7: The number of available macros are easily expanded to 1 million or even 10 million. Refer to [**Src-1M-macros**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/tree/main/TouchMacroPadPico/Src-1M-macros), which is also in the Build folder there as **VolumeMacroPadPico35IPS272**. This has 1,079,568 possible nKeys, or 833 pages of 12 keys for each of the 36 first characters over the three different sets of files. All 9,996 nKeys per character are easily accessed via the Pad+ and Pad- PageUp and PageDown Pads.

<img src="images/FlashFS1.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> <img src="images/FlashFS2.jpg" width="40" height="30"/>When the TouchLCD is programmed at first, the Flash FS will contain only three files *Config1 80, TimersData 36, and TouchCalData 10*. (The numbers after the filename is the size in bytes) By pressing [Cfg][Sav] with a serial monitor attached a list of all the files on the Flash FS and SDCard FS will be shown, as well as other configuration data. It is possible to choose the SDCard as the FS for all the macro definition files, which reads and writes much faster and reduces Flash wear.<br>

Usability guidelines for touch macro pads are difficult to find, but the [**Material Design Layout Guidelines**](https://m2.material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#layout-anatomy) are in part, applicable. Note that the preious versions of these guidelines were easier to apply as a usability design tool. 

<img src="images/handposition.png" width="40" height="30"/> The Touch LCD is used more conveniently when placed upright rather than lying flat, and then using your thumb-tip to press the 5 option pads, and the larger key pads. The single-touch characteristic of resistive touch overlays is in this case advantageous. Place one or two fingers on top or behind, the LCD to stabilise it when using your thumb to press the keys. This orientation is then similar to the current use of both thumbs to manipulate smartphones touch screens from the side, as opposed to using other fingers pushing on the touchscreen front.

For the Pico 2 the [**Waveshare IPS ILI9488 Pico Touch Display 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-3.5.htm), the [**Waveshare TFT ILI9486 Raspberry Pi Type C 125MHz LCD 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/3.5inch-rpi-lcd-c.htm) with an added SDCard holder, and the [**Waveshare ST7789 2.8 inch 320x240 LCD**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-2.8.htm), were tested. For the Pico 1 RP2040 three additional LCD displays were tested - refer to the [**Pico 1 Touch Pad**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/tree/main/TouchMacroPadPico) for a list of the six Touch LCDs used there.

Not all SDCard brands work equally well - Sandisk, Toshiba, and Samsung SDCards have been used without any problems - if after a cold start the Touchpad does not respond, and only works after the HW reset button had been pressed, then replace the SDCard with another brand. As an alternative, enable the on-start-reset with \*r1\* - but doing this will prevent the Touchpad from being used during the Boot/BIOS phase.
